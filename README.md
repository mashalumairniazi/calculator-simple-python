# Simple Calculator in Python

This is a Python-based calculator project that supports basic arithmetic operations and provides fun facts after each calculation. 
I've used all my skills as of now in this, as I'm learning, and it was my first time using the 'import' command. This is also my first time writing a long program. A few simple prototypes were made of really simple if-command calculators, but this is the most I could do with my current knowledge.

Hopefully my next program will be much more advanced!

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Random fun facts about computers, Python, calculators, and math after each calculation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fun_calculator.git
   cd fun_calculator
